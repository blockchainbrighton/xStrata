Okay, so just in case we have to stop working now on the Xstrata app, just to have some notes on what's been going on. I've been working on V3.0. Each time we've had some good outcomes, I've updated the version number up to 3.10. That's the last fully working version. 3.0 may be in trouble at this point. I've also imported V1, because V1 has still got all the build stuff in it, and I'm wondering whether there's a way we can port 3.10 into a new version of V1, which maybe we make a V4, which is actually the simplified version of V1, with all of the updates identified from V3.10, but just put back into a version with all of the build options, so hopefully it gives us a bit more flexibility. But if we can get V1 working again with all of the updates from V3.10 into a new V4, I think that'll put us in a good place.
